    "With that settled your main focus will be your quests board. That is where you'll insert your To Dos, from here on called quests as you predicted correctly, weow!",
    "When adding a quest you'll find it needs a tier. This tier is the level of difficulty you feel it will take. Why does it matter? Well fine sir, depending on the quest's tier you'll get different stats when you complete it. You're free to make it as hard or easy on yourself as you wish, however, we both know honesty with yourself is the best policy.",
    "By completing quests you get experience points and energy points. Experience makes you level up. Each time you level up you get to face a D&D creature. You both roll a 6D and upon winning you capture it into your own bestiary. Mind you there are 334 creatures so if you gotta catch them all, it most certainly will keep you busy.",
    "Energy points are meant to be used in your secondary board which is another list, but this one is destined for rewards. Yes! For some of our neurospicy fellas completing quests may feel like an endless cycle of work and no fun... Where is the dopamine?! We want you to pamper yourself with tangible goals.",
    "Rewards have a tier too. The higher the tier the more energy you need to unlock it. Your energy bar has a cap so be sure to treat yourself ok? Be creative, get rewards that make you feel giddy or cozy, small and big treats, that thing you wanted so BAD! Maybe having an afternoon to do just nothing sounds nice from time to time.",
    "Badabim Badabom! These are the basics, we trust you can manage from here on your own. Only you know where the road ahead leads you weary traveler. Follow it or go off the beaten path. Make the best out of it."
